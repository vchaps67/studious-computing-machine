Project 2:  IRSF Fraud Detection using Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project simulates and detects International Revenue Share Fraud (IRSF) using synthetic Call Detail Records (CDRs). We explore both supervised and unsupervised learning models to identify anomalous calling behavior and compare their performance.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Synthetic CDRs Generated**: 100,000
- **Fields Included**:
  - `A_number`: Originating number
  - `B_number`: Destination number
  - `Duration`: Call duration in seconds
  - `Timestamp`: Date and time of the call
  - `Day`: Day of the week
  - `True_Fraud`: Ground truth fraud label (hidden during unsupervised training)
  - `Manual_Fraud_Tag`: Simulated manual tagging (used in supervised training)

---

## 🛠 Feature Engineering

We created additional features from the original data:
- `Hour`: Extracted from timestamp
- `Is_International`: Flag based on country code difference
- `Is_Weekend`: Based on `Day`
- `Day_encoded`: Numeric encoding of day

---

## 📌 Modeling Approaches

### 1️⃣ Supervised Learning - Random Forest

- **Train/Test Size**: 70/30 split
- **Features Used**: `Duration`, `Hour`, `Is_International`, `Is_Weekend`, `Day_encoded`
- **Evaluation on 30,000 samples**:

| Metric            | Value    |
|-------------------|----------|
| Accuracy          | 80.19%   |
| Precision (Fraud) | 20.2%    |
| Recall (Fraud)    | 24.2%    |
| F1-Score (Fraud)  | 22.0%    |

🔎 Note: Class imbalance impacts precision/recall — further techniques like SMOTE or ensemble methods could improve this.

---

### 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning - Isolation Forest

- **Entire dataset evaluated (100,000 CDRs)**
- **Anomaly scores used for fraud detection**
- **Compared with hidden `True_Fraud` labels**:

project 55 : DNS Threat Detection: DGA & Tunneling Detection System
Problem Statement: The DNS Security Challenge
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols have become critical attack vectors for sophisticated cyber threats. Traditional security solutions struggle with two particularly evasive techniques:

Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs)
Malware uses DGAs to generate thousands of random domain names daily, enabling:

Command-and-control (C2) communication

Evasion of domain blacklists

Resilient botnet operations
Detection Challenge: Differentiating algorithmically generated domains from legitimate human-created domains

DNS Tunneling
Attackers encode data in DNS queries to:

Exfiltrate sensitive data

Bypass network firewalls

Establish covert communication channels
Detection Challenge: Identifying malicious payloads in seemingly normal DNS traffic

The Critical Gap: Traditional signature-based detection fails against these threats due to:

Constantly changing domain patterns (DGAs)

Encryption and obfuscation techniques (tunneling)

Massive volume of DNS traffic (over 100B daily queries)

Low false-positive tolerance in enterprise environments


This project implements a multi-layered detection system combining:

Deep Learning for sequence pattern recognition (DGA)

Anomaly Detection for identifying outliers (tunneling)

Hybrid Rule Engine to reduce false positives

Key Features
Real-time DGA Detection: 98.3% accuracy on Cryptolocker variants

Tunneling Identification: 94.1% detection rate for iodine tunneling

Hybrid Analysis: 37% fewer false positives than pure ML approaches

Test Infrastructure: Custom DGA generator for model validation

Production-Ready API: <10ms/query processing latency

2. Model Specifications

Character-level embeddings

Bidirectional LSTM layers

Attention mechanism

Output: Malicious probability (0-1)

Tunneling Detection (Isolation Forest)

Features:

Shannon entropy of domain

Domain length
