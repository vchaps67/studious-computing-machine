Project 2:  Voice Fraud Detection System


### Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive machine learning system for detecting voice fraud using call detail records (CDR) and call parameters. The system identifies four distinct types of telecommunications fraud through advanced ML techniques and real-time pattern analysis.

**Duration:** 6 months | **Role:** Lead ML Engineer | **Team Size:** Individual Project

---

### Problem Statement
Telecommunications fraud costs the industry billions annually, with sophisticated attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in voice networks. Traditional rule-based systems struggle with evolving fraud patterns and high false positive rates. The challenge was to build an ML system that could:

- Detect multiple fraud types with high accuracy
- Minimize false positives to avoid disrupting legitimate traffic
- Handle severely imbalanced datasets (fraud rate ~15%)
- Provide real-time detection capabilities
- Offer actionable insights for network operations teams

### Fraud Types Targeted
1. **IRSF (International Revenue Share Fraud)** - Artificially inflating traffic to high-cost destinations
2. **SIM Box Fraud** - Illegal GSM termination to bypass international settlement rates
3. **Subscription Fraud** - Using fake accounts for service testing and verification bypass
4. **Bypass Fraud** - Illegal routing to avoid legitimate termination fees

---

1. Daily call volume patterns (>100 calls/day for SIM Box)
2. Route cost anomalies (>$0.30/min for IRSF)
3. Account age vs. activity correlation
4. International routing complexity (>8 hops suspicious)
5. Call duration patterns by fraud type

#### Fraud-Specific Detection Thresholds
- **IRSF**: Calls >20 minutes to premium destinations + new accounts
- **SIM Box**: >100 calls/day with quick answer times (<3 seconds)
- **Subscription Fraud**: >300 calls/day from accounts <5 days old

project 55 : DNS Threat Detection: DGA & Tunneling Detection System
Problem Statement: The DNS Security Challenge
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols have become critical attack vectors for sophisticated cyber threats. Traditional security solutions struggle with two particularly evasive techniques:

Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs)
Malware uses DGAs to generate thousands of random domain names daily, enabling:

Command-and-control (C2) communication

Evasion of domain blacklists

Resilient botnet operations
Detection Challenge: Differentiating algorithmically generated domains from legitimate human-created domains

DNS Tunneling
Attackers encode data in DNS queries to:

Exfiltrate sensitive data

Bypass network firewalls

Establish covert communication channels
Detection Challenge: Identifying malicious payloads in seemingly normal DNS traffic

The Critical Gap: Traditional signature-based detection fails against these threats due to:

Constantly changing domain patterns (DGAs)

Encryption and obfuscation techniques (tunneling)

Massive volume of DNS traffic (over 100B daily queries)

Low false-positive tolerance in enterprise environments


This project implements a multi-layered detection system combining:

Deep Learning for sequence pattern recognition (DGA)

Anomaly Detection for identifying outliers (tunneling)

Hybrid Rule Engine to reduce false positives

Key Features
Real-time DGA Detection: 98.3% accuracy on Cryptolocker variants

Tunneling Identification: 94.1% detection rate for iodine tunneling

Hybrid Analysis: 37% fewer false positives than pure ML approaches

Test Infrastructure: Custom DGA generator for model validation

Production-Ready API: <10ms/query processing latency

2. Model Specifications
DGA Detection (LSTM Network)

Character-level embeddings

Bidirectional LSTM layers

Attention mechanism

Output: Malicious probability (0-1)

Tunneling Detection (Isolation Forest)

Features:

Shannon entropy of domain

Domain length

Vowel-consonant ratio

Subdomain depth

Request frequency
