Project 1:  IRSF Fraud Detection using Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project simulates and detects International Revenue Share Fraud (IRSF) using synthetic Call Detail Records (CDRs). We explore both supervised and unsupervised learning models to identify anomalous calling behavior and compare their performance.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Synthetic CDRs Generated**: 100,000
- **Fields Included**:
  - `A_number`: Originating number
  - `B_number`: Destination number
  - `Duration`: Call duration in seconds
  - `Timestamp`: Date and time of the call
  - `Day`: Day of the week
  - `True_Fraud`: Ground truth fraud label (hidden during unsupervised training)
  - `Manual_Fraud_Tag`: Simulated manual tagging (used in supervised training)

---

## 🛠 Feature Engineering

We created additional features from the original data:
- `Hour`: Extracted from timestamp
- `Is_International`: Flag based on country code difference
- `Is_Weekend`: Based on `Day`
- `Day_encoded`: Numeric encoding of day

---

## 📌 Modeling Approaches

### 1️⃣ Supervised Learning - Random Forest

- **Train/Test Size**: 70/30 split
- **Features Used**: `Duration`, `Hour`, `Is_International`, `Is_Weekend`, `Day_encoded`
- **Evaluation on 30,000 samples**:

| Metric            | Value    |
|-------------------|----------|
| Accuracy          | 80.19%   |
| Precision (Fraud) | 20.2%    |
| Recall (Fraud)    | 24.2%    |
| F1-Score (Fraud)  | 22.0%    |

🔎 Note: Class imbalance impacts precision/recall — further techniques like SMOTE or ensemble methods could improve this.

---

### 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning - Isolation Forest

- **Entire dataset evaluated (100,000 CDRs)**
- **Anomaly scores used for fraud detection**
- **Compared with hidden `True_Fraud` labels**:

| Metric            | Value    |
|-------------------|----------|
| Accuracy          | 99.94%   |
| Precision (Fraud) | 97.1%    |
| Recall (Fraud)    | 99.8%    |
| F1-Score (Fraud)  | 98.5%    |

✅ Isolation Forest proved highly effective in this synthetic setup.

## 📈 Comparison Summary

| Model                         | Accuracy | Precision (Fraud) | Recall (Fraud) | F1-Score (Fraud) |
|------------------------------|----------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Random Forest (Supervised)   | 80.19%   | 20.2%             | 24.2%          | 22.0%            |
| Isolation Forest (Unsupervised) | 99.94% | 97.1%             | 99.8%          | 98.5%            |

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- **Unsupervised models like Isolation Forest can be extremely effective** in detecting IRSF, especially where labeled data is scarce.
- **Supervised learning benefits from richer features and balanced datasets** — future iterations can explore feature engineering and cost-sensitive learning.
- **This project demonstrates a practical machine learning pipeline** applicable to telecom fraud detection, including data generation, modeling, and evaluation.

Project 2: GPON Fault Detection using Machine Learning
This project applies both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect faults in a GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) system. It compares the performance of Random Forest and Isolation Forest models on synthetic fault data to illustrate how AI can help in predictive maintenance and service assurance in telecommunications.


🔍 Objective
To proactively detect network faults in GPON infrastructure using ML techniques, helping reduce downtime and improve network performance.

🛠️ Project Highlights
✅ Supervised Learning with RandomForestClassifier

🔍 Unsupervised Learning with IsolationForest

📊 Confusion matrices and classification reports for model evaluation

🧪 Feature scaling with StandardScaler

🧠 Built using scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib

📁 Dataset
A synthetic dataset was generated with 1000 records and includes features such as:

signal_strength

latency

packet_loss

jitter

uptime

rx_power

tx_power

fault (0: normal, 1: fault)

🧪 Results
🔹 Random Forest (Supervised)
High precision and recall for both fault and normal states.

Robust performance in labeled environments.

Best suited for structured and labeled operational datasets.

🔹 Isolation Forest (Unsupervised)
Useful for anomaly detection without labeled data.

Good at identifying abnormal patterns that may indicate faults.

📈 Visualization
Two confusion matrices compare the predictive power of the two models, showing that supervised models like Random Forest outperform unsupervised ones when labels are available. However, Isolation Forest remains a valuable tool in real-world, label-sparse environments.



Project 1: Payment Fraud Detection

Description: This project is about detection on payment fraud using a number of models. Intial data was lablled with no observable outliers. The aim of the project is to increase the time to detect fraud and thus reduce the impcat of the fraud. Its aslo tries to enhace the develdopment of fraud prevention strategies.  There were no observable fraud patterns from the data set. However the decstion tree and ensemble methods perfommed well, but oulier methods like IsolationForest performed poorly

Tools Used:  Python.

Key Findings: Detection of novel fraud methods for dataset with little or no obervable outliers is a problem

Project 2: Bank Card Fraud Dashboard

Description :  Developed an interactive fraud detection dashboard to monitor and analyze credit card transactions, enabling real-time fraud monitoring, fraud status at a particular point in time  and pattern recognition. 

Tools: Tableau, Python

Key Objectives
Monitor fraud patterns and trends in real-time
Identify high-risk transaction patterns
Track geographical distribution of fraudulent activities
Analyze customer segments and fraud occurrence
Measure and visualize key fraud metrics
